# Reflection

## What part of the code was most confusing and why?
The most confusing part was understanding how setInterval keeps running independently of the rest of the program. It took some time to understand how clearInterval stops the loop at the right moment.

## How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
The animation makes asynchronous behavior visible by updating the screen over time without freezing the page. Seeing the symbols change helped me understand that JavaScript schedules repeated actions instead of running everything at once.

## What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?
I added a background color change when the animation finishes. This made it more visually clear when the asynchronous loop stopped and helped reinforce how clearInterval controls timing.
